### Sokoban puzzle solver
The goal for a Sokoban puzzle, is that the player will have to push all the boxes into the pits to win the level. <br> 
This project aimed to solve the Sokoban puzzle using classical artificial intelligence approach - search algorithm. 

In detail, the search algorithm used is **astar graph search**.

### Cartpole problem
This is a classical reinforcement learning problem. The cart can choose from the actions of left or right. For each state / timeframe, if the pole is still "being balanced" (i.e., non-terminal or truncated states) then agent receive a reward of +1. The agent also additionally receieve a reward at terminal or truncated state.
The goal of the game is try to balance the pole as long as possible. <br>
The approach here is to use tabular form of **Monte-Carlo back up** of the state-action pair values. 

Below is the agent at the early stage of the learning process. As can be seen due to the lack of learning experience, the game reaches terminal or truncated states very soon.

As the time elapsed, the state-action pairs got updated and the policy got improved.

### CPU design
Starting from a module we explored the construction of cellular automation within Matlab. This is a first time I was introduced to Conway's Game of Life. <br> 
While fasinated by the patterns and constructions such as glider guns, spaceship, eater etc, soon after I discovered Game of Life is proven to be Turing Complete. Where my journey of Computer Architecture begins. <br>
Below is my first attempt to construct logic gates in Game of Life. (In fact, it is a 8-bit adder - parallel data output, ripple adder, with delays introduced by traversal of gliders)

This is a project I've accomplished in a game simulator "Turing Complete". The provides logic gates simulation and timing signal. <br>
Below is a design I created.

Besides the CPU, I also experiment with making some components.

### Firefighter bot
This is a group project I participated in 2023, University Microcontroller Hackathon. The theme is "Autonomous system". <br>
